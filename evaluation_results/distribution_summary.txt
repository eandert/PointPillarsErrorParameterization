DISTRIBUTION EQUATIONS REFERENCE:
====================================================================================================

Normal Distribution:
  f(x) = (1/(σ√(2π))) * exp(-(x-μ)²/(2σ²))
  Parameters: μ (mean), σ (standard deviation)

Laplace Distribution:
  f(x) = (1/(2b)) * exp(-|x-μ|/b)
  Parameters: μ (location), b (scale)

Cauchy Distribution:
  f(x) = 1/(πγ(1+((x-x₀)/γ)²))
  Parameters: x₀ (location), γ (scale)

Student-t Distribution:
  f(x) = Γ((ν+1)/2) / (√(νπ)Γ(ν/2)) * (1+(x-μ)²/(νσ²))^(-(ν+1)/2)
  Parameters: ν (degrees of freedom), μ (location), σ (scale)
  Note: As ν→∞, Student-t approaches Normal

Logistic Distribution:
  f(x) = exp(-(x-μ)/s) / (s*(1+exp(-(x-μ)/s))²)
  Parameters: μ (location), s (scale)


====================================================================================================
INTERPRETATION GUIDE:
====================================================================================================

- Normal: Errors are Gaussian distributed (most common assumption)
- Laplace: Heavier tails than Normal, often fits when there are outliers
- Cauchy: Very heavy tails, robust to extreme outliers
- Student-t: Generalizes Normal with adjustable tail heaviness
- Logistic: Similar to Normal but slightly heavier tails

If Laplace or Student-t fits best, consider:
- Using L1 loss (MAE) instead of L2 loss (MSE) for training
- The error model should account for outliers

If errors are heteroscedastic (variance increases with distance):
- Consider distance-dependent error models
- Weight predictions by distance for uncertainty estimation
