# PointPillars KITTI - Best-Fit Error Distributions
# These are used for SAMPLING actual errors (not prediction)
# Based on evaluation with 'All' vehicle category
#
# Format: error_type,dist_min,dist_max,distribution,param1,param2,param3
#   distribution types: normal, laplace, logistic, student_t, cauchy
#   normal:    param1=mu, param2=sigma
#   laplace:   param1=mu, param2=b (scale)
#   logistic:  param1=mu, param2=s (scale)
#   student_t: param1=nu (df), param2=mu, param3=sigma
#   cauchy:    param1=x0 (location), param2=gamma (scale)
